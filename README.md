##### WordPress-Post-Connector

# Product Description & Purpose

WordPress hosts a vast array of data types, all of which can now be brought into the Knowledge Graph with just a few clicks! Download this connector to link to your WordPress account and pull post entities of different types into the Knowledge Graph. Each connector will pull in a different entity type, so you will have to download multiple if you would like to pull in different types such as Media and Pages.

This simple app automatically syncs posts details such as content, author details, photo gallery, and categories to Yext on a daily cadence. Any time you add, update, or remove posts in WordPress these same changes will occur in Yext. Now you can extend the reach of your WordPress posts even further to power Yext products such as Answers and Pages! 

This app creates a custom Post entity type and the following custom fields:
- wp_activeOnAnswers
- wp_alternativeCaption
- wp_author
- wp_authorDescription
- wp_authorLandingPage
- wp_caption
- wp_categories
- wp_content
- wp_dateModified
- wp_datePosted
- wp_height
- wp_isSticky
- wp_postExcerpt
- wp_sourceURL
- wp_tags
- wp_width

# Requirements

### To use this template you will need to have the following before you install:

- a WordPress account
- your WordPress domain  

*Note: If your connector shows an error related to authentication, your site might have a private API, in which case you will need to set up application passwords. Learn how to do so in our [WordPress guide](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/guides/answers-wordpressintegration-guide/01-pull-wordpress-data-into-yext/).*
